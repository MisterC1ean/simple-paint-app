This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Title

This app allows you to paint a picture using some randomly selected colors in a certain palette. I used this project to practice with React Hooks and to check out the online learning platform Scrimba.

## Motivation

I have very little experience with React Hooks up to this point and saw this as an opportunity to learn more about them by coding something from scratch with guidance. With a better base of knowledge about hooks I can start implementing them into my other projects.

## Installation

Run npm install to load all dependencies then run npm start to load the development server. From there you can navigate the app. ( *** NOTE there is no backend at this time so reloading the page will destroy your precious creation..take a screen shot if you really love it )

## Tech Used
# Built with;
ReactJS, React Hooks, CSS, Random Color Library

# Credit to Scrimba and their awesome platform for making courses like this to teach new Developers things they don't know.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
